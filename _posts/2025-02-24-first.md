# Simple start
A few things I wanted to test:
- I had already created skills-github-pages as a 'pages' repo under my personal account. Would I also be able to create the canonical drr.github.io repo and have both be available via appropriate URLs? Yes!
- With drr.gh.io I wanted to start with just an index.html and not configuring anything other than repo settings. Again, yes! Looking at the gh deployment it did run the jekyll build process, but did had nothing to process and it included my index.html in the deployed archive.
- Next I wanted to try creating canonical _posts with jekyll md, and that worked (but note they are not linked to anything so I have to manually enter the URL).
- Finally, I tried creating ./blog/index.html and while that was processed for formatting, it did not automatically link to the posts.

## Next time
- Try out using a different root directory in the gh pages repo settings. If I do, will it still include html files from above the publishing-root, or does it only work from the defined publishing-root down?
